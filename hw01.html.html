    <p><b>Favorite place</b><br /> <img src='images/sunset_park.jpg' height="300" ALIGN="left">
    My favorite place is Sunset Park in Brooklyn, New York. Growing up, I would 
    often go to Brooklyn to visit family living there and Sunset Park, with its
    beautiful scenery and vibrant community, is the place I remember best. 
    Although I don't get to go as often anymore, I still reminisce about the
    precious times I spent there with my grandparents. </p>
